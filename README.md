# AI Solar Panel

An innovative self-adjusting solar panel system that maximizes energy absorption using computer vision and deep learning.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the deep learning component of our AI-powered solar panel tracking system. The project aims to optimize solar energy capture by accurately tracking the sun's position in real-time, using a lightweight deep learning model running on a microcontroller.

## Key Features

- **Sun Position Detection**: Utilizes a lightweight deep learning model for real-time sun tracking in various weather conditions.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Designed to run efficiently on a Teensy or Arduino microcontroller.
- **Automated Adjustment**: Provides coordinates to guide the solar panel's orientation for maximum sunlight exposure.
- **Fallback Algorithm**: Implements a non-ML algorithm for tracking during heavy cloud cover or rain.
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors wattage generation and usage for comparison between algorithmic and deep-learning modes.
- **Adaptive Detection Intervals**: Adjusts detection frequency based on sun movement to optimize power usage.
- **Camera Management**: Activates the camera only when needed for detection to conserve energy.

## System Architecture

1. 480p-720p camera captures sky images
2. Deep learning model detects sun's position
3. Microcontroller processes input and calculates optimal panel alignment
4. Servo motors adjust panel's azimuth and attitude

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Lightweight deep learning model (YOLOv8 converted via LiteRT)
- **Hardware**: Teensy or Arduino Microcontroller
- **Additional Sensors**: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for current position and orientation
- **Programming Languages**: C++ for firmware and control mechanisms, Python for the deep learning model
- **Power Management**: Ensures peak wattage draw does not exceed average power generated
- **Location Detection**: Automatically determines the system's geographical location for accurate sun tracking
